== Notifications, for Google Chrome ==

Source code base to create notification extensions for Google Chrome. You can find more information and a ready to install example at http://ayotli.com/notifications/

To customize this code for your own extension, you just have to modify from background.js lines 1 to 3, and modify or rewrite lines 32 to 47, this last depending on the page resources.

You might also want to comment and uncomment some lines in options.html and options.js (https option is commented by default since most pages don't use it, and to serve as example).

Also, don't forget to change in options.html the sitename in lines 21 and 23, as well as default pages in the same lines.
